# MyWebCV
This is my webCv project.

# Project requirements
- Python 3+

# Starting the project and testing
The best way I'v found to just launch the site for this application was to just 

- Download the project in a ZIP format or cloning the repo
- Inside the folder, and with the python already installed, start a python server
```
python -m http.server
```
- Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser and have fun !
